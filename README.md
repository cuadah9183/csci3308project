# Nutrilog

Our applicationâ€™s primary feature will be a daily log/calendar for tracking meals and nutrition. The user will be able to register and login to our website. Each user will be able to see the history of their logs and be able to save entered meals. The user will be able to look up recipes via a 3rd party API and save them as preset meals.
