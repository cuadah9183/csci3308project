TA Meeting Notes

11-2-2022

What we talked about:
For every user story, our commits should be on a separate branch and not the main branch. Make sure to add commit messages.
Make sure to commit 3 times a week. Does not expect us to commit every day.
Include release notes by the end of each week. Depending on the functional deliverable for the week. EX: front end, back end, API deliverables.
Update your readme and release notes. Deliverable = functional in nature. The main branch code needs to always be in working condition. 
Make sure all group members contribute equally.
Epics are created using labels.Change web page development on the project board.
Login/Logout are mandatory.
